    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has become popular due to its clear syntax and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often used as a scripting language, but it's also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.\n"
